# FizzBuzz


## Description

Script that prints the integers from n to m (inclusive):

• for multiples of three, print Fizz (instead of the number)

• for multiples of five, print Buzz (instead of the number)

• for multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz (instead of the number)

Inputting integers need to satisfy condition 1 <= n < m <= 10000.
